# multiclass_animal_image_classification
This project uses an unsupervised learning approach to solve multiclass 
animal image recognition using deep learning convolutional neural network 
(CNN). The dataset used for the implementation of this project are images of 
cats , dogs and pandas . The images of each category of animals were grouped 
together in separate labelled folders and each folder contains 1000 images of 
the same species. The dataset is available at
